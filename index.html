              "Stadspark" means "city park" in English, it is a park in the
              city, as the name already indicates.ðŸ˜‰ The Stadspark is not the
              only park in Groningen, but it is a very large park. When you walk
              far enough into the park, you can have the idea that you are in a
              calm area and you can forget that you are in a very busy and
              crowded city.
            </p>

              There is a lot to see at the Stadspark in Groningen. There are a
              lot of plants and animals you can spot. Even when you only focus
              on the birds, you can spot a wide variety of this class in the
              Stadspark: common blackbirds, coal tits, ducks, gulls, pigeons,
              robins, rooks, woodpeckers and last but not least, the widely
              represented and ubiquitous geese.

            Allongside all the different birds, you can spot other wild animals
            like rabbits and squirrels. There are also highland cattles in one
            area. Beside all the animals which are running wild in the park,
            there is also a petting zoo with another diversity of animals.

              There are people doing sport activities in the park, like jogging
              and skating. There are also a lot of people who or walking the
              dog. Or people who like to walk just by themselves, like me. There
              is also a playground in the park, where mostly young kids are
              playing. Now you can see empty play equipment, because the weather
              was "bad" at that moment.

              When the weather is "bad"; when it is rainy and wet and when it is
              cold outside, there are less people outside. That is the moment
              that the park is in the most peaceful and tranquil state. Then is
              the moment that you can spot the most animals you otherwise would
              not see. (But they can be hard to photograph as well. ðŸ˜…)

            Every day is unique, because of the various weather circumstances
            and the different seasons. You can see new appearances of nature
            every day. So no day is the same at the park. The Stadspark keeps
            developing and growing in it's own unique way. And something can
            seem to emerge out of nowhere the next day, like a flower or a
            previously hidden and small animal. You can see a new color in the
            sky, in the water and/or on the plants.

            The Stadspark is a big park, so at first I could get lost. I could
            have no idea where I was. Nowadays I know exactly where I am, I have
            gained a lot of experience and wisdom. Sometimes I see a wandering
            traveler looking around and asking me where they are and then I am
            there for them to help them, giving them instructions how to reach
            the busy city again.
